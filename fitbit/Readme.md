# Fitbit analysis

the following analysis inside the [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Lukas-Forst/data-analysis/blob/main/fitbit/fitbit-activity-analysis.ipynb) contains an analysis of <br />
fitbit data from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit). The goal besides being a [coursera capstone project](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone) was to use __R__ instead of Python. <br />
Used librarys:
- Visualization: ggplot2, plotly, patchwork
- Cleaning: tidyverse, lubridate, dplyr
- Exploration: skimr

The goal of the project was to create an analysis that can be used from the executive team of Bellabeat to improve their products. <br />

plotly_viz_html_files.zip contains generated plotly files not visible in jupyter notebook.

To watch the live version visit the [kaggle_project](https://www.kaggle.com/katanoro/fitbit-activity-analysis/notebook#Summary) which supports interactive plotly charts.
