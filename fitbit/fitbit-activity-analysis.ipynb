What are some trends in smart device usage?\n\n#### Overall smart device trends\n\n\"Lastly, despite a relatively high selling price, smartwatch and wristband ownership is climbing, having risen by 58% since 2017. <br />\nHaving now passed the early adoption phase, they’re proving popular with health-conscious individuals and status-seekers.\" <br />\nMain devices used are smartphones, laptops/PCs and tablets. In the age group 55 to 64 Tablets are owned more often compared to younger age groups.\"\n[1](https://www.gwi.com/reports/device)\n\n#### Smartwear\n\n- Asia Pacific has the highest ownership of smartwach/ smartwristband, with 1 in 5 owning either.\n- The largest group comes from the Singapore & Hong Kong region with a 29% and 28% owning either.\n- In the UK and US Apple, Samsung and Fitbit are the leading Brands with a share of 56%, 16% and 7% respectively\n- Smartwatch Apple is with a marketshare of 56% are leading brands. \n- Fitbit has only a marketshare of 4% but acquisition of Google can increase the marketshare.\n[1](https://www.gwi.com/reports/device) [2](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/smart-wearables-market)\n\n- Besides the market share another trend is going towards health with blood sugar measurement and early detection of diseases like covid. [3](https://www.ispo.com/en/news-sports-experts/six-latest-trends-smartwatches) \n- Smart bracelet instead of a watch they look like a beautiful bracelet which Bellabeat already are. [3](https://www.ispo.com/en/news-sports-experts/six-latest-trends-smartwatches)\n- longer battery life \n- Authentication is another trend like unlocking your home, getting into concerts [4](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/wearables/the-future-of-wearable-technology/1/)\n\n2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?\n\nIncreasing ownership of smartwachtes and smartwristbands leads to a higher adoption across different markets and larger customer groups. <br />\nFor Bellabeat customers that means that more products, services and other will be created to fulfill their needs. <br />\nThe product can also be used at a festival to get access or for other authentication needs besides being used as a smartwatch <br />\nBellabeat products can also be used as a health monitor.\n\n3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?\n\nYou will produce a report with the following deliverables:\n1. A clear summary of the business task\n2. A description of all data sources used\n3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data\n4. A summary of your analysis\n5. Supporting visualizations and key findings\n6.

As we saw people are most active in the week in the time between 9 and 17. People are mostly active after 16 in the week, which may come from people working between 9 to 16.\n2. BellaBeat should recommend or add a feature to animate its users to get up for a few minutes and walk to increase their daily step count. The goal should be to hit 10000 Steps \n3.
