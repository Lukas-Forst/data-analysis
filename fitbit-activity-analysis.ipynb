Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. <br />\nUrška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. <br />\nYou have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices.<br />\n\n\n### About the company\nUrška Sršen and Sando Mur founded Bellabeat, a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products. <br />\nSršen used her background as an artist to develop beautifully designed technology that informs and inspires women around <br />\nthe world. Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with <br />\nknowledge about their own health and habits. Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly <br />\npositioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women. <br />\nBy 2016, Bellabeat had opened offices around the world and launched multiple products. Bellabeat products became available <br />\nthrough a growing number of online retailers in addition to their own e-commerce channel on [their website](https://bellabeat.com/). The company <br />\nhas invested in traditional advertising media, such as radio, out-of-home billboards, print, and television, but focuses on digital <br />\nmarketing extensively. Bellabeat invests year-round in Google Search, maintaining active Facebook and Instagram pages, and <br />\nconsistently engages consumers on Twitter. Additionally, Bellabeat runs video ads on Youtube and display ads on the Google <br />\nDisplay Network to support campaigns around key marketing dates. <br />\nSršen knows that an analysis of Bellabeat’s available consumer data would reveal more opportunities for growth. She has <br />\nasked the marketing analytics team to focus on a Bellabeat product and analyze smart device usage data in order to gain <br />\ninsight into how people are already using their smart devices. Then, using this information, she would like high-level <br />\nrecommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy <br />","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Business question\n\n1. What are some trends in smart device usage?\n\n#### Overall smart device trends\n\n\"Lastly, despite a relatively high selling price, smartwatch and wristband ownership is climbing, having risen by 58% since 2017. <br />\nHaving now passed the early adoption phase, they’re proving popular with health-conscious individuals and status-seekers.\" <br />\nMain devices used are smartphones, laptops/PCs and tablets. In the age group 55 to 64 Tablets are owned more often compared to younger age groups.\"\n[1](https://www.gwi.com/reports/device)\n\n#### Smartwear\n\n- Asia Pacific has the highest ownership of smartwach/ smartwristband, with 1 in 5 owning either.\n- The largest group comes from the Singapore & Hong Kong region with a 29% and 28% owning either.\n- In the UK and US Apple, Samsung and Fitbit are the leading Brands with a share of 56%, 16% and 7% respectively\n- Smartwatch Apple is with a marketshare of 56% are leading brands. \n- Fitbit has only a marketshare of 4% but acquisition of Google can increase the marketshare.\n[1](https://www.gwi.com/reports/device) [2](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/smart-wearables-market)\n\n- Besides the market share another trend is going towards health with blood sugar measurement and early detection of diseases like covid. [3](https://www.ispo.com/en/news-sports-experts/six-latest-trends-smartwatches) \n- Smart bracelet instead of a watch they look like a beautiful bracelet which Bellabeat already are. [3](https://www.ispo.com/en/news-sports-experts/six-latest-trends-smartwatches)\n- longer battery life \n- Authentication is another trend like unlocking your home, getting into concerts [4](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/wearables/the-future-of-wearable-technology/1/)\n\n2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?\n\nIncreasing ownership of smartwachtes and smartwristbands leads to a higher adoption across different markets and larger customer groups. <br />\nFor Bellabeat customers that means that more products, services and other will be created to fulfill their needs. <br />\nThe product can also be used at a festival to get access or for other authentication needs besides being used as a smartwatch <br />\nBellabeat products can also be used as a health monitor.\n\n3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?\n\nYou will produce a report with the following deliverables:\n1. A clear summary of the business task\n2. A description of all data sources used\n3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data\n4. A summary of your analysis\n5. Supporting visualizations and key findings\n6.

As we saw people are most active in the week in the time between 9 and 17. People are mostly active after 16 in the week, which may come from people working between 9 to 16.\n2. BellaBeat should recommend or add a feature to animate its users to get up for a few minutes and walk to increase their daily step count. The goal should be to hit 10000 Steps \n3. Another feature could be to challenge users like: \"walk through a park nearby today\" or \"visit a museum this Sunday\".\n4.
